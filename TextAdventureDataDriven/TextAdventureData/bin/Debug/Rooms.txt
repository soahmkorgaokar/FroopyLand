You enter the room and it is chaos. The furniture in the room is broken\n
and has fungus growing on it
here are rays of light entering the room through gaps in the ceiling
You look around and see a ray of light bouncing from an object in the room
Being very cautious, you approach the object and find it to be a Gold Coin
HURRAY!!
There is only one exit to the room, heading west.
